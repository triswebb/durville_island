Classical problems of ecosystem loss and fragmentation have largely been countered in some regions by reservation of 30\% of total land area. Unsustainable harvesting of native biodiversity has stopped; indeed harvesting of terrestrial species is rare. In contrast, marine reserves do not cover even 1\% of the managed area, and harvest of native species, some of it unsustainable, are a major industry. Introduced pests, especially mammals, are the overwhelming conservation problem. Legislation, management, and considerable public opinion is based on preservationist ideals that demand the sanctity of native land biodiversity. Considerable success in threatened species management, island eradications, and mainland control of pests is increasing opportunities for restoration. New legislation is increasingly built on concepts of sustainability and offers the opportunity for integrating conservation, use, and development....},

@article{Crutzen1990,
	abstract = {Biomass burning is widespread, especially in the tropics. It serves to clear land for shifting cultivation, to convert forests to agricultural and pastoral lands, and to remove dry vegetation in order to promote agricultural productivity and the growth of higher yield grasses. Furthermore, much agricultural waste and fuel wood is being combusted, particularly in developing countries. Biomass containing 2 to 5 petagrams of carbon is burned annually (1 petagram = 10(15) grams), producing large amounts of trace gases and aerosol particles that play important roles in atmospheric chemistry and climate. Emissions of carbon monoxide and methane by biomass burning affect the oxidation efficiency of the atmosphere by reacting with hydroxyl radicals, and emissions of nitric oxide and hydrocarbons lead to high ozone concentrations in the tropics during the dry season. Large quantities of smoke particles are produced as well, and these can serve as cloud condensation nuclei. These particles may thus substantially influence cloud microphysical and optical properties, an effect that could have repercussions for the radiation budget and the hydrological cycle in the tropics. Widespread burning may also disturb biogeochemical cycles, especially that of nitrogen. About 50 percent of the nitrogen in the biomass fuel can be released as molecular nitrogen. This pyrdenitrification process causes a sizable loss of fixed nitrogen in tropical ecosystems, in the range of 10 to 20 teragrams per year (1 teragram = 10(12) grams).},

	abstract = {Aim The increased incidence of large fires around much of the world in recent decades raises questions about human and non-human drivers of fire and the likelihood of increased fire activity in the future. The purpose of this paper is to outline a conceptual framework for examining where human-set fires and feedbacks are likely to be most pronounced in temperate forests world-wide and to establish and test a methodology for evaluating this framework using palaeoecological records. Location Tasmania, north-western USA, southern South America and New Zealand. Methods We outline a conceptual framework for predicting the sensitivity of ecosystems to human impacts on fire regimes and then use a circum-Pacific comparison of existing historical reconstructions of fire, climate, human settlement and vegetation to evaluate this approach. Results Previous research investigating important controls on fire activity shows that the sensitivity of temperate ecosystems to human-set fires is modulated by the frequency of natural fire occurrence, fuel moisture and fuel type and availability. Palaeoecological data from four temperate regions suggest that the effects of anthropogenic burning are greatest where fire is naturally rare, vegetation is poorly adapted to fire and fuel biomass is abundant and contiguous. Alternatively, where fire activity is naturally high and vegetation is well adapted to fire, evidence of human influence on fire and vegetation is less obvious. Main conclusions Palaeofire records suggest that the most dynamic and persistent ecosystem transitions occur where human activities increase landscape flammability through fire-vegetation feedbacks. Rapid forest transitions in biomassrich ecosystems such as New Zealand and areas of Tasmania and southern South America illustrate how landscapes experiencing few fires can shift past tipping points to become fire-prone landscapes with new alternative stable state communities. Comparisons of palaeoecological data from different regions with similar biophysical gradients but different human settlement histories can provide new opportunities for understanding ecosystem vulnerability to fire-climate-human interactions.},

@article{Bucini2002,
	abstract = {The objectives of this study were to understand the role of fires on land-cover changes, and conversely the role of vegetation cover as a controlling factor of fires. The study, which was conducted in a region at the savannah/forest transition in the southwestern part of the Central African Republic, explores the differential impact on land cover of early- and late-season fires and analyses burning regimes as a function of human use of the land. This was addressed using multivariate regression models between maps of land-cover change derived from remote sensing data, maps of burnt areas and a detailed map of ecotypes. In dense forests, burning is strongly associated with land-cover changes, while in savannahs the occurrence of (mostly) early fires does not lead to land-cover change. Fires associated with continuous and fragmented burnt patches have similar impacts on vegetation cover. Dense semi-humid forests in the study area were affected by a high level of burning due to land uses at their peripheries. The results confirm recent findings concerning human control on the timing of burning in savannahs. Early fires fragment the landscape and prevent the spatial diffusion of later damaging fires. Where no human settlements are present, late fires become more prevalent. Finally, the study measured an increase in vegetation cover in a few areas affected by very early burning. Using burnt area rather than active fire data allowed a better analysis of the spatial association between landscape attributes and burning events. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {In most parts of the world where people have colonized and modified their landscapes for several millennia or more, it is often difficult to discriminate anthropogenic burning from natural fire regimes that are linked to climate regimes. New Zealand provides a unique setting for identifying human influence on fire occurrence because it was settled recently (c. AD 1280) at a time when climates are considered to be similar to today. Late-Holocene pollen and charcoal records from New Zealand provide striking evidence for initial Polynesian (Maori) arrival being strongly associated with widespread burning and loss of native forest. The duration of initial forest clearance and the spatial pattern of burning that led to this transformation are still poorly understood. We present high-resolution charcoal and pollen analyses of sediment cores from five lakes, located on the deforested eastern side of the Southern Alps. These records document the local fire history of the last 1000 years and the response of vegetation and watersheds to burning. Our results suggest that one to several high-severity fires occurred within a few decades of initial Maori arrival, and this 'Initial Burning Period' (IBP) resulted in the majority of forest loss and erosion. Changes in sedimentation rates, soil chemistry and magnetic susceptibility occurred simultaneously with the first fires at some sites, and marked the end of the IBP at others, suggesting substantial and rapid alteration of watershed vegetation, soil and biochemistry. Timing of the beginning of the IBP varied across sites but the duration of this period was brief (decades to a century). Our results suggest that Maori burning of native forests was deliberate and systematic. These forests had no previous history of fire and thus showed little resilience to the introduction of a new disturbance.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade there has been an intense debate as to whether New Zealand prehistory is ‘long’ (>1500yr), ‘short’ (<600yr) or ‘intermediate’ (c.1000yr). Pollen and charcoal analyses have played a key role in this debate by pinpointing the transition from relatively undisturbed environments to those deforested by anthropogenic fires. We review pollen and stratigraphic studies carried out on a variety of sites, including peat bogs, swamps, estuaries and lakes, and contribute new results. Different sedimentary environments show varying susceptibilities to contamination and have resulted in a wide spread of ages for initial Maori impact. Peat and macrofossils from bogs are the least susceptible to contamination by old or young carbon, whereas lakes and swamps are subject to inwash of old carbon and hard water effects. Silty sediments appear to be particularly vulnerable to contamination. Analysis of 14C dates for the start of Maori deforestation show that ages falling in the ‘long’ prehistory period are exclusively derived from lakes and swamps. In contrast, the bulk of the ages falling in the ‘short’ prehistory period are from bogs. We conclude the first evidence of Maori environmental impact dates to 1200–1400 AD (750–550 calendar years BP). Finer age resolution is limited by the uncertainty associated with identifying the first signs of human impact and variability of the 14C calibration curve.},

	abstract = {Historically, New Zealand was dominated by forest below the alpine treeline, but about 1000 years of Polynesian and European colonisation has resulted in the destruction of nearly three-quarters of the indigenous forest cover. In this study, the historical patterns of deforestation and forest fragmentation were assessed in relation to major topographical, climatic and anthropogenic variables that may drive forest loss. Deforestation has occurred almost equally on the two main islands, the North and South Islands, although the remaining indigenous forest is more fragmented in the North Island. Most deforestation has occurred in regions with a high-density of road networks, although gradients in climatic water availability and soil fertility also had weak effects. Deforestation rates over the period 1997-2002 were very low (nationwide deforestation rate of just -0.01\% p.a.), but varied widely among political districts. Expansion of plantation forestry was the single most important driver of recent deforestation. Only 10 of 73 political districts are afforded long-term protection of native forest cover (having more than 30\% forest cover that is managed by the Department of Conservation). Forest cover in the majority of New Zealand landscapes has been reduced below the level of an expected 'extinction threshold' (circa 30\% native habitat cover) in 55 political districts, and long-term trajectories predict that ongoing deforestation threatens to force another five districts below the critical threshold within the next 45 years. Except for the most heavily deforested regions, relatively modest annual rates of habitat restoration could bring forest cover back above the extinction threshold by the year 2050. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Climate change creates new challenges for biodiversity conservation. Species ranges and ecological dynamics are already responding to recent climate shifts, and current reserves will not continue to support all species they were designed to protect. These problems are exacerbated by other global changes. Scholarly articles recommending measures to adapt conservation to climate change have proliferated over the last 22 years. We systematically reviewed this literature to explore what potential solutions it has identified and what consensus and direction it provides to cope with climate change. Several consistent recommendations emerge for action at diverse spatial scales, requiring leadership by diverse actors. Broadly, adaptation requires improved regional institutional coordination, expanded spatial and temporal perspective, incorporation of climate change scenarios into all planning and action, and greater effort to address multiple threats and global change drivers simultaneously in ways that are responsive to and inclusive of human communities. However, in the case of many recommendations the how, by whom, and under what conditions they can be implemented is not specified. We synthesize recommendations with respect to three likely conservation pathways: regional planning; site-scale management; and modification of existing conservation plans. We identify major gaps, including the need for (1) more specific, operational examples of adaptation principles that are consistent with unavoidable uncertainty about the future; (2) a practical adaptation planning process to guide selection and integration of recommendations into existing policies and programs; and (3) greater integration of social science into an endeavor that, although dominated by ecology, increasingly recommends extension beyond reserves and into human-occupied landscapes.},

Understanding past fire dynamics and their relationship to these factors is thus a key factor in preserving and managing present biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Unfortunately, our understanding of the disturbance dynamics of past fires is incomplete, and many open questions exist relevant to these concepts and the related methods. In this paper we describe the present status of the fire-regime concept, discuss the notion of the fire continuum and related proxies, and review the most important existing approaches for reconstructing fire history at centennial to millennial scales. We conclude with a short discussion of selected directions for future research that may lead to a better understanding of past fire-regime dynamics. In particular, we suggest that emphasis should be laid on (1) discriminating natural from anthropogenic fire-regime types, (2) improving combined analysis of fire and vegetation reconstructions to study long-term fire ecology, and (3) overcoming problems in defining temporal and spatial scales of reference, which would allow better use of past records to gain important insights for landscape, fire and forest management. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {1. Abrupt changes and regime shifts are common phenomena in terrestrial ecological records spanning centuries to millennia, thus offering a rich opportunity to study the patterns and drivers of abrupt ecological change. 2. Because Quaternary climate changes also often were abrupt, a critical research question is to distinguish between extrinsic versus intrinsic abrupt ecological changes, i.e. those externally driven by abruptly changing climates, versus those resulting from thresholds, tipping points, and other nonlinear responses of ecological systems to progressive climate change. Extrinsic and intrinsic abrupt ecological changes can be distinguished in part by compiling and analysing regional networks of palaeoecological records. 3. Abrupt ecological changes driven by spatially coherent and abrupt climate changes should manifest as approximately synchronous ecological responses, both among different taxa at a site and among sites. However, the magnitude and direction of response may vary among sites and taxa. Ecological responses to the rapid climatic changes accompanying the last deglaciation offer good model systems for studying extrinsic abrupt change. 4. When abrupt ecological changes are intrinsically driven, the timing and rate of ecological response to climate change will be strongly governed by local biotic and abiotic processes and by stochastic processes such as disturbance events or localized climatic extremes. Consequently, at a regional scale, one should observe ‘temporal mosaics’ of abrupt ecological change, in which the timing and rate of ecological change will vary among species within sites and among sites. These temporal mosaics are analogous to the spatial mosaics observed in ecological systems prone to threshold switches between alternate stable states. The early Holocene aridification of the North American mid-continent and the middle-Holocene aridification of North Africa may be good examples of temporal mosaics. 5. Synthesis. Past instances of extrinsic and intrinsic abrupt change are of direct relevance to global-change ecologists. The former allow study of the capacity of ecological systems to quickly adjust to abrupt climate changes, while the latter offer opportunities to understand the ecological processes causing abrupt local responses to regional climate change, to test tools for predicting critical thresholds, and to develop climate-adaptation strategies.},

	abstract = {Plant invasions are widely recognized as significant threats to biodiversity conservation worldwide. One way invasions can affect native ecosystems is by changing fuel properties, which can in turn affect fire behavior and, ultimately, alter fire regime characteristics such as frequency, intensity, extent, type, and seasonality of fire. If the regime changes subsequently promote the dominance of the invaders, then an invasive plant–fire regime cycle can be established. As more ecosystem components and interactions are altered, restoration of preinvasion conditions becomes more difficult. Restoration may require managing fuel conditions, fire regimes, native plant communities, and other ecosystem properties in addition to the invaders that caused the changes in the first place.We present a multiphase model describing the interrelationships between plant invaders and fire regimes, provide a system for evaluating the relative effects of invaders and prioritizing them for control, and recommend ways to restore pre- invasion fire regime properties},

	abstract = {Although the impacts of exotic plant invasions on community structure and ecosystem processes are well appreciated, the pathways or mechanisms that underlie these impacts are poorly understood. Better exploration of these processes is essential to understanding why exotic plants impact only certain systems, and why only some invaders have large impacts. Here, we review over 150 studies to evaluate the mechanisms underlying the impacts of exotic plant invasions on plant and animal community structure, nutrient cycling, hydrology and fire regimes. We find that, while numerous studies have examined the impacts of invasions on plant diversity and composition, less than 5\% test whether these effects arise through competition, allelopathy, alteration of ecosystem variables or other processes. Nonetheless, competition was often hypothesized, and nearly all studies competing native and alien plants against each other found strong competitive effects of exotic species. In contrast to studies of the impacts on plant community structure and higher trophic levels, research examining impacts on nitrogen cycling, hydrology and fire regimes is generally highly mechanistic, often motivated by specific invader traits. We encourage future studies that link impacts on community structure to ecosystem processes, and relate the controls over invasibility to the controls over impact.},

Drawing on evidence from paleoecological observations, recent phenological and microevolutionary responses, experiments, and computational models, we review the insights that different approaches bring to anticipating and managing the biodiversity consequences of climate change, including the extent of species' natural resilience. We introduce a framework that uses information from different sources to identify vulnerability and to support the design of conservation responses.

@article{Chambers1999,
	abstract = {1. A characteristic of some heath and moorland areas in maritime north-west Europe is the widespread dominance of Molinia caerulea (purple moor grass). The overwhelming local supremacy of this species concerns farmers, owing to its relatively low palatability for grazing stock, and conservationists, owing to the monotonous, species-poor landscapes that often result under Molinietum. 2. In some environmentally sensitive areas (ESAs) in England and Wales, Molinietum is believed to have ousted Callunetum in recent decades; experiments sponsored to control the species have predicated its infiltration and replacement of heather-dominated stands. 3. Experimental control of Molinia in ESAs on Exmoor, England, was paralleled by palaeoecological studies to verify its recent rise, assess its status in moorland, and test the utility of the techniques for such research. 4. Peat profiles from two localities on Exmoor were sampled and subjected to recently developed techniques of plant macrofossil counting and to conventional pollen analysis. One locality was ‘white moor’, clearly dominated by Molinia; the other was ‘grey moor’ (an admixture of ericaceous shrubs) that had become invaded (allegedly recently) by Molinia. 5. Dating of profiles employed a range of methods, including conventional radiocarbon dating, Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) dating and the counting of spheroidal carbonaceous particles, to attempt to delimit horizons of recent peat growth. 6. The pollen and macrofossil data confirmed the recent ousting of Calluna and rise to dominance of Molinia in the grey moor, but also provided evidence of an earlier unsuspected (pre-Callunetum) presence of Molinia. The overwhelming dominance of Molinia in the white moor was also a recent phenomenon, but was only partly at the expense of Calluna. The palaeoecological data indicated a greater antiquity and former abundance of Molinia than is often appreciated and suggested that, over the past millennium, vegetation dominance has alternated between Callunetum and grass moor containing at least some Molinia, while the former Calluna-dominated grey moor itself developed originally from grass moor. 7. These findings have implications for conservation management and for restoration targets in ‘degraded’ moorland. Similar palaeoecological studies have since been adopted in Wales, directly to inform conservation and management policy.},

Spikes in pollen of broadleaf trees and shrubs, mainly before 2500 cal yr BP, may indicate warmer or wetter intervals. Remobilized old charcoal, along with peaks in Poaceae, Cyathea, and Lophosoria, indicate a possible large tropical storm event around 2900 cal yr BP. Transported clasts of peat and soil in the core signal other high precipitation events. We found no clear evidence of prehistoric human activity. },

	abstract = {The charcoal record contained in lake sedimentary sequences is often used to infer past fire events. Studies to calibrate such charcoal records have been carried out in a range of mid- to high-latitude regions and relationships have been determined between size and quantity of charcoal in the sediment and proximity and spatial extent of the fires. Very little is known, however, about the relationship between fire events in savanna ecosystems and how these are represented in the charcoal record in lake sedimentary sequences. This study presents the results of a project that aimed to calibrate the micro- and macroscopic charcoal record from Kruger National Park, South Africa, with known fire events. Surface sediment samples were analysed for charcoal of different size classes and compared with data on fire proximity, area and intensity (the rate of energy released along a fire front) from fire events over the last 10 years, and the relevant source areas for micro- and macroscopic charcoal were quantified. Results indicated that (i) the Relevant Source Area of Charcoal for lakes c. 200 m diameter is between 0 and 5 km for charcoal particles {\textgreater}50 mu m in length and between 10 and 15 km for charcoal particles {\textless} 50 mu m; (ii) that charcoal deposits are most likely to represent combined fire events from the preceding five years; (iii) that fire proximity, area and intensity are each significantly represented in the charcoal record, but not equally, as the signal resulting from fire intensity is stronger than that for fire proximity or area. Mathematical equations linking charcoal with fire proximity, area and intensity are presented.},

Fossil pollen is commonly interpreted as suggesting that the range of many temperate tree species expanded at rates of 100-1000 m/yr during the early Holocene. We used chloroplast DNA surveys to show that the geography of postglacial range expansion in two eastern North American tree species differs from that expected from pollen-based reconstructions and from patterns emerging from European molecular studies. Molecular evidence suggests that American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and red maple (Acer rubrum) persisted during the late glaciation as low-density populations, perhaps within 500 km of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Because populations were closer to modern range limits than previously thought, postglacial migration rates may have been slower than those inferred from fossil pollen. Our estimated rates of 100 m/yr are consistent with model predictions based on life history and dispersal data, and suggest that past migration rates were substantially slower than the rates that will be needed to track 21st-century warming.},

	abstract = {Islands play a key role globally in the conservation of endemic species. Many island reserves have been highly modified since human colonization, and their restoration and management usually occur without knowledge of their prehuman state. However, conservation paleoecology is increasingly being recognized as a tool that can help to inform both restoration and conservation of island reserves by providing prehuman vegetation baselines. Many of New Zealand's mammal-free offshore islands are foci for biological diversity conservation and, like many islands in the Polynesian region, were deforested following initial human settlement. Therefore, their current restoration, replanting, and management are guided either by historic vegetation descriptions or the occurrence of species on forested islands. We analyzed pollen and ancient DNA in soil cores from an offshore island in northern New Zealand. The result was a 2000-year record of vegetation change that began {\textgreater}1200 years before human settlement and spanned 550 years of human occupation and 180 years of forest succession since human occupation ceased. Between prehuman and contemporary forests there was nearly a complete species turnover including the extirpation of a dominant conifer and a palm tree. The podocarp-dominated forests were replaced by a native but novel angiosperm-dominated forest. There is no modern analog of the prehuman forests on any northern New Zealand island, and those islands that are forested are dominated by angiosperms which are assumed to be climax forests. The pollen and DNA evidence for conifer- and palm-rich forests in the prehuman era challenge this climax forest assumption. Prehuman vegetation records can thus help to inform future restoration of degraded offshore islands by informing the likely rate and direction of successional change; helping to determine whether natural rates of succession are preferable to more costly replanting programs; and providing past species lists if restoration replanting is desired.

	abstract = {Introduced species of mammals have now been removed from many islands around New Zealand, thus providing singular opportunities for ecological restoration. If island restoration is to be attempted, the way island biota originate and the precise effects of introduced organisms must be identified. Plants introduced to the New Zealand archipelago may have transitory effects, but others may modify forest structure and disrupt succession. Goats have been the most destructive introduced herbivore on islands. Among introduced predators, cats have extirpated colonies of seabirds, and rats (depending on species) affect invertebrates, lizards, and birds. Ecological theories and concepts that may help with island restoration projects include: the keystone species concept, in which the effects of one species on others is disproportionate relative to its abundance; the "intermediate predator" hypothesis, where removal of the top introduced predator may lead to rebound effects of intermediate predators; and ecological chain reactions, where local extinction of some species can cause complicated multiple effects. Problems with restoration of islands may be encountered because of meagre data on the previous effects of pests (such as predators), use of non-seral species in revegetation projects, proliferations of indigenous or introduced species that have unforeseen community effects, and inexplicable difficulties with some translocations. A restoration case study in the continental Mercury Islands and on Cuvier Island showed success with removal of introduced mammals and demonstrates the various effects of introduced browsers, grazers, and predators. A contrasting case study is provided by oceanic Mangere Island in the Chatham Islands where 22 species of avifauna have been lost, seven as permanent extinctions. Restoration targets for some New Zealand islands can be clarified by palaeoecological studies of Maori (Polynesian) middens and natural deposits. Understanding the role of disturbance in island systems may also help clarify restoration targets. When exotic keystone species are introduced, physical disturbance may be overridden by biotic disturbance. This replacement in turn has implications for trophic structure. With high levels of biotic disturbance, continental islands may be changed from relatively species-rich bottom-up food webs to species-poor top-down trophic cascades. These possibilities can be tested with an experimental approach to restoration, although such experiments may be hard to interpret because of difficulties with replicates and controls. Ecological restoration en New Zealand islands has potential to replace damaged or lost communities, expand the ranges of relict populations, reduce the selective influence of exotic (keystone) species on indigenous species, help in understanding how the systems are formed, provide opportunities for educational and scientific investigation, and act as a testing ground for new technologies against pests},

	abstract = {Kapiti Island is a nature reserve of 1965 ha, lying off the west coast of the North Island of New Zealand about 50 km north of its southern extremity. It is famous for its abundant and readily observed birdlife and has a variety of species now rare on the mainland. The island also houses the last viable population of the little spotted kiwi Apteryx oweni, the smallest of New Zealand's three species of ratites. The browsing of Australian marsupial brushtail possums Trichosurus vulpecula introduced to Kapiti in 1893 seriously threatened the island's vegetation and wildlife. Possum numbers had been reduced by trapping at various times during 1920-1968. In 1980, a programme began involving several Government management and research agencies, which resulted in the eradication of possums from the island by the end of 1986. The island was divided into blocks, each covered by a network of individually identified and mapped tracks. A combination of trapping, aerial poisoning and trained dogs was used to eradicate possums systematically from each block. During the seven years of the programme, about 21 000 possums were killed in about 1 399 000 trap nights, 4500 hours of searching with dogs, and aerial poisoning of 330 ha of steep cliffs. Details of the eradication programme are described, its costs and benefits, and comments are made on the reasons for its success, and lessons for future eradication attempts. ?? 1992.},

	abstract = {An ecological collapse has precipitated pioneering conservation initiatives in New Zealand. Many terrestrial communities in the New Zealand archipelago have been devastated by over-exploitation, introduced mammals and habitat destruction. More recently, marine ecosystems have been depleted by over-harvesting. To mitigate against these losses, conservation in terrestrial environments has focused on protection of species and habitats. A similar approach is now under way in marine environments with the establishment of 'no-take' marine reserves. On land, conservation is now reaching beyond protection to the eradication of pests from islands and restoration of their terrestrial ecosystems. Restoration on islands not only reduces threats to rare species; it also raises opportunities to investigate how species interact. In the sea, marine reserves not only enhance the diversity of depleted marine communities; they may also augment stocks of commercially harvested species. These initiatives provide many lessons that could be applied to degraded habitats elsewhere.},

	abstract = {New Zealand's offshore and outlying islands have long been a focus of conservation biology as sites of local endemism and as last refuges for many species. During the c. 730 years since New Zealand has been settled by people, mammalian predators have invaded many islands and caused local and global extinctions. New Zealand has led international efforts in island restoration. By the late 1980s, translocations of threatened birds to predator-free islands were well under way to safeguard against extinction. Non-native herbivores and predators, such as goats and cats, had been eradicated from some islands. A significant development in island restoration in the mid-1980s was the eradication of rats from small forested islands. This eradication technology has been refined and currently at least 65 islands, including large and remote Campbell (11 216 ha) and Raoul (2938 ha) Islands, have been successfully cleared of rats. Many of New Zealand's offshore islands, especially those without predatory mammals, are home to large numbers of breeding seabirds. Seabirds influence ecosystem processes on islands by enhancing soil fertility and through soil disturbance by burrowing. Predators, especially rats, alter ecosystem processes and cause population reductions or extinctions of native animals and plants. Islands have been promoted as touchstones of a primaeval New Zealand, but we are now increasingly aware that most islands have been substantially modified since human settlement of New Zealand. Archaeological and palaeoecological investigations, together with the acknowledgement that many islands have been important mahinga kai (sources of food) for Maori, have all led to a better understanding of how people have modified these islands. Restoration technology may have vaulted ahead of our ability to predict the ecosystem consequences of its application on islands. However, research is now being directed to help make better decisions about restoration and management of islands, decisions that take account of island history and key drivers of island ecosystem functioning.

	abstract = {Garry oak (Quercus garryana) ecosystems are listed as ‘‘at-risk'' or endangered throughout their global range. In Canada, they are an umbrella for over one hundred species that are endangered to some degree. In order to effectively recover or allow these species to persist where possible, understanding of the ecological processes essential to their ongoing survival is needed. Fire suppression, aboriginal land-use, climate change, and post-colonial development have lead to drastic changes in the structure and amount of Garry oak ecosystems in North America. This paper presents new data using pollen and charcoal analysis to reconstruct past vegetation change and disturbance regimes for Garry oak and coastal Douglas-fir ecosystems over the past *500 years. Significant change in vegetation at the study sites has occurred with the greatest change in community structure and decline in Garry oak ecosystems occurring after the end of the Little Ice Age and as the impacts of western colonization occurred in the mid to late 19th century. Understanding mean fire return intervals (MFRI), ecosystem dynamics over time, and the role of people in this ecosystem structure is critical to the success of conservation efforts that are designed to ensure the long-term survival of these communities. The MFRI, inferred from charcoal analysis, ranges from 26 to 41 years on Vancouver and Pender Islands, Canada. Our results indicate that fire suppression, cessation of aboriginal land-use, climate change, western colonization and subsequent intensification of land-use has greatly altered Garry oak ecosystems. This study illustrates the utility of using paleoecological investigations to help in the development of land management strategies and prescribed burn plans.},

This unusual extinction of large and slow-breeding animals provides some of the strongest support for a human contribution to their extinction and is consistent with vari- ous human hunting models, but it is difficult to explain by models relying solely on environmental change. It is an oversimplification, however, to say that a wave of hunting-induced extinctions swept continents immediately after first human contact. Results from re- cent studies suggest that humans precipitated extinction in many parts of the globe through combined direct (hunting) and perhaps indirect (competition, habitat alteration) impacts, but that the tim- ing and geography of extinction might have been different and the worldwide magnitude less, had not climatic change coincided with human impacts in many places.},

	abstract = {Evidence from microscopic charcoal particle stratigraphy is presented from nine locations distributed throughout Kaua'i in the Hawaiian Islands, including windward and leeward coastal sites and interior bogs at elevations ranging up to 1220 m. The overall trends are comparable with those reported for other mesic tropical island areas lacking strong seasonality, beginning with a general dearth of charcoal in sediments that predate evidence for humans on the island, followed by an increase of an order of magnitude or more at a time that probably represents first human presence at the site. In most cases, this initial peak or plateau of increased charcoal from presumably anthropogenic sources is followed by a prehistoric decrease and a second peak after European contact. Charcoal evidence presented here suggests a human presence in leeward coastal areas beginning ca. 830+-50 yr B.P. (1050-1095, 1140-1280 cal yr A.D.). One windward site, Limahuli Bog, may show charcoal evidence for humans as early as 1470+-60 yr B.P. (440-670 cal yr A.D.), but resolution is poor in the upper part of that core. Charcoal and sedimentological evidence suggests that Hawaiians were constructing fishponds as early as about eight centuries ago and that the massive stoneworks forming the Alekoko or Menehune Fishpond, probably the largest prehistoric stone structure in the Hawaiian Islands, may have been completed by 580+-30 yr B.P. (1305-1420 cal yr A.D.). Charcoal peaks in pre-human times, particularly at 3800+-40 yr B.P. (4080-4290 cal yr B.P.), may be associated with prolonged drought conditions. Charcoal particles are virtually absent from the late Pleistocene sediments collected from interior bogs.},

	abstract = {We studied a ca 200 ha large forest site that holds an exceptionally large number of red-listed saproxylic beetles. We conducted pollen, charcoal and dendroecological analyses to reveal the long-term stand-level history of the site. We also investigated which of the red-listed saproxylic beetles recorded at the site are probably dependent on forest fires or structures that are created by fires. Pollen from Pinus and Betula dominate the pollen diagram, and the pollen record shows that the canopy is more closed today than ever during the last 2500 years. Large amounts of charcoal fragments were found throughout the core except during three shorter periods, one of which is the latest ca 200 years. The dendroecological investigation revealed 11 different fires, the earliest dated to {\{}AD{\}} 1586 and the last dated to {\{}AD{\}} 1868. Of the 105 red-listed saproxylic beetles recorded at the site, at least 12 are associated with open forests with Pinus sylvestris or Birch spp. trees. We conclude that the fires, as recorded both by the charcoal and dendroecological analysis, kept the site largely open in the past, and this is likely one important explanation for the high conservation value of the site today. Other important factors could be that the site is rich in boulders, the relatively warm summer climate in the region, that Picea abies has not been planted in the surroundings until recently, and finally the presence of many old trees. The study supports the theory that fire could have been an important factor for keeping some forest types open before the large human impact on the northwestern European forests started. },

We use pollen assemblages from tree islands throughout the greater Everglades ecosystem to reconstruct the timing of tree island formation, patterns of development, and response to specific climatic and environmental stressors. These data indicate that fixed (teardrop-shaped) and strand tree islands developed well before substantial human alteration of the system, with initial tree island vegetation in place between 3500 and 500 calibrated years before present (cal yr BP), depending on the location in the Everglades wetland. Tree island development appears to have been triggered by regional- to global-scale climatic events at 2800 cal yr BP, 1600–1500 cal yr BP, 1200–1000 cal yr BP (early Medieval Warm Period), and 500–200 cal yr BP (Little Ice Age). These periods correspond to drought intervals documented in Central and South America and periods of southward displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The records indicate a coherence of climate patterns in both subtropical North America and the Northern Hemisphere Neotropics. Water management practices of the 20th century altered plant communities and size of tree islands throughout the Everglades. Responses range from loss of tree islands due to artificially long hydroperiods and deep water to expansion of tree islands after flow reductions. These data provide evidence for the rapidity of tree island response to specific hydrologic change and facilitate prediction of the response to future changes associated with Everglades restoration plans.},

Vegetation types sampled include sawgrass marshes, cattail marshes, sloughs with floating aquatics, wet prairies, brackish marshes, tree islands, cypress swamps, and mangrove forests. The distribution of these vegetation types is controlled by specific environmental parameters, such as hydrologic regime, nutrient availability, disturbance level, substrate type, and salinity; ecotones between vegetation types may be sharp. Using R-mode cluster analysis of pollen data, we identified diagnostic species groupings; Q-mode cluster analysis was used to differentiate pollen signatures of each vegetation type. Cluster analysis and the modern analog technique were applied to interpret vegetational and environmental trends over the last two millennia at a site in Water Conservation Area 3A. The results show that close modern analogs exist for assemblages in the core and indicate past hydrologic changes at the site, correlated with both climatic and land-use changes. The ability to differentiate marshes with different hydrologic and edaphic requirements using the pollen record facilitates assessment of relative impacts of climatic and anthropogenic changes on this wetland ecosystem on smaller spatial and temporal scales than previously were possible. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {The pristine island ecosystems of East Polynesia were among the last places on Earth settled by prehistoric people, and their colonization triggered a devastating transformation. Overhunting contributed to widespread faunal extinctions and the decline of marine megafauna, fires destroyed lowland forests, and the introduction of the omnivorous Pacific rat (Rattus exulans) led to a new wave of predation on the biota. East Polynesian islands preserve exceptionally detailed records of the initial prehistoric impacts on highly vulnerable ecosystems, but nearly all such studies are clouded by persistent controversies over the timing of initial human colonization, which has resulted in proposed settlement chronologies varying from approximately 200 B.C. to 1000 A.D. or younger. Such differences underpin radically divergent interpretations of human dispersal from West Polynesia and of ecological and social transformation in East Polynesia and ultimately obfuscate the timing and patterns of this process. Using New Zealand as an example, we provide a reliable approach for accurately dating initial human colonization on Pacific islands by radiocarbon dating the arrival of the Pacific rat. Radiocarbon dates on distinctive rat-gnawed seeds and rat bones show that the Pacific rat was introduced to both main islands of New Zealand approximately 1280 A.D., a millennium later than previously assumed. This matches with the earliest-dated archaeological sites, human-induced faunal extinctions, and deforestation, implying there was no long period of invisibility in either the archaeological or palaeoecological records.},

This paper presents a study of the fire history of Lago di Origlio in the southern Swiss Alps. The study utilises the technique of mineral magnetism alongside the stratigraphic pollen, spore and charcoal records. Correlation between the various proxy records indicates that a magnetic 'fire' record is present within the sediments for the last 4 ka. The magnetic fire record has a distinct mineralogical and magnetic grain size signature that can be recognised against the background sedimentary signal. The results suggest that magnetic measurements may be usefully employed in the reconstruction of fire history.

	abstract = {High-resolution analysis of macroscopic charcoal in sediment cores from Little Lake was used to reconstruct the fire history of the last 9000 years. Variations in sediment magnetism were examined to detect changes in allochthonous sedimentation associated with past fire occurrence. Fire intervals from ca. 9000 to 6850 calendar years BP averaged 110 +/- 20 years, when the climate was warmer and drier than today and xerophytic vegetation dominated. From ca. 6850 to 2750 calendar years BP the mean fire interval lengthened to 160 +/- 20 years in conjunction with the onset of cool humid conditions. Fire-sensitive species, such as Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don, Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg., and Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr., increased in abundance. At ca. 4000 calendar years BP, increases in allochthonous sedimentation increased the delivery of secondary charcoal to the site. From ca. 2750 calendar years BP to present, the mean fire interval increased to 230 +/- 30 years as cool humid conditions and mesophytic taxa prevailed. The Little Lake record suggests that fire frequency has varied continuously on millennial time scales as a result of climate change and the present-day fire regime has been present for no more than 1000 years.},

	abstract = {South African grasslands support a rich flora that is attracting growing conservation interest. Fire has long been used to manage grasslands for livestock production. However, there is very little information on the effects of fire on forb diversity to help guide conservation management. We studied plant diversity at scales of 1 and 100 m2 in three long-term burning experiments in mesic, montane and semi-arid grasslands, respectively, to explore forb responses to different fire regimes. Though the dominant grasses were strongly influenced by season and frequency of fire, forb diversity showed no consistent trends. Ordination results showed that forb composition varied less with fire treatment than with local site conditions. Forbs in all three grasslands seem remarkably resilient to fire. However, all three sites showed large compositional changes if fires were excluded for about 10 or more years, with the replacement of many species by a suite of, mostly, woody species. Patterns of beta-diversity sampled in the montane grassland, showed somewhat different patterns, with species turnover increasing with inter-fire interval. Our results indicate that most forb species tolerate a wider range of season and frequency of fires than the dominant grasses. However, to accommodate those species with low tolerance of frequent fires, parts of the landscape will require less frequent fires.},

Fire is also a significant evolutionary force, and is one of the first tools that humans used to re-shape their world.

	abstract = {The only fully coupled land-atmosphere global climate model predicts a widespread dieback of Amazonian forest cover through reduced precipitation. Although these predictions are controversial, the structural and compositional resilience of Amazonian forests may also have been overestimated, as current vegetation models fail to consider the potential role of fire in the degradation of forest ecosystems. We examine forest structure and composition in the Arapiuns River basin in the central Brazilian Amazon, evaluating post-fire forest recovery and the consequences of recurrent fires for the patterns of dominance of tree species. We surveyed tree plots in unburned and once-burned forests examined 1, 3 and 9 years after an unprecedented fire event, in twice-burned forests examined 3 and 9 years after fire and in thrice-burned forests examined 5 years after the most recent fire event. The number of trees recorded in unburned primary forest control plots was stable over time. However, in both once- and twice-burned forest plots, there was a marked recruitment into the 10-20cm diameter at breast height tree size classes between 3 and 9 years post-fire. Considering tree assemblage composition 9 years after the first fire contact, we observed (i) a clear pattern of community turnover among small trees and the most abundant shrubs and saplings, and (ii) that species that were common in any of the four burn treatments (unburned, once-, twice- and thrice-burned) were often rare or entirely absent in other burn treatments. We conclude that episodic wildfires can lead to drastic changes in forest structure and composition, with cascading shifts in forest composition following each additional fire event. Finally, we use these results to evaluate the validity of the savannization paradigm.},

	abstract = {Interpretations of charcoal records from small hollows lack a strong theoretical and empirical foundation, and thus their potential for providing useful fire-history   records is unclear. To evaluate this potential, we examined charcoal records in 210Pb-dated cores from 12 small hollows and looked for evidence of 20   local fires reconstructed with tree-ring records from the surrounding forest. Using all charcoal {\textgreater} 0.15 mm wide we established an optimum threshold that   identified charcoal peaks corresponding to known fires while minimizing charcoal peaks identified that were not associated with known fires (i.e., false positives).  This threshold detected four of four high-severity fires, five of 10 moderate-severity fires, and three of six low-severity fires. Analysis of larger   charcoal alone ({\textgreater} 0.50 mm wide) yielded nearly identical temporal patterns and detection rates, but four false positives were identified, twice as many as   identified using all charcoal {\textgreater}0.15 mm wide. Charcoal peak magnitude was highly variable within severity classes: although half of the low-and moderate-severity fires left no detectable peaks, others left peaks larger than some high-severity fires. Our results suggest that fire detection depends strongly on fire severity and that fine-scale spatial patterns of lower-severity burns play an important role in determining the charcoal signature of these events. High detection   rates for high-severity fires and low false-positive rates indicate that charcoal records from small hollows will be most useful in systems where fires are large,  severe and infrequent.},

	abstract = {The correct interpretation of charcoal records in a palaeoecological context requires the understanding of the sources and transport of charcoal particles. Conventionally, it is assumed that macroscopic charcoal particles are not   transported far from fires (c. 200m). Therefore macroscopic charcoal records are used to reconstruct local fire frequencies. However, the general   scarcity of empirical and experimental evidence impedes a thorough check of this assumption. In this study we present the first unambiguous evidence of kilometre-scaled macroscopic charcoal transport in Europe. During the hot summer of 2003 an intensive crown fire occurred in Leuk, central Swiss Alps. It affected 300 ha of forest as well as 10 ha of pasture and fallow land. Litter traps and nets had been located approximately 5 km west and east of the burned area. The downwind site in the east (Jeizinen) recorded a strong charcoal fallout at 5.3 km from the fire edge. The observed charcoal influx of fragments with a size up to 1.3 cm reached average values of 0.144 and 0.098 mm2/Cm2   per fire (or yr) in five traps and two nets, respectively. These values are comparable with charcoal accumulations measured at only c. 50 m from large fires, suggesting that macroscopic charcoal transport does not decay rapidly to zero with increasing distance from the fire. We suggest a long-distance dispersal model for   transport of macroscopic charcoal during large fire events. Reconstructions of local fire regimes may be affected by long-distance transport of macroscopic charcoal,  although this problem is mitigated by the tendency of most macroscopic charcoal particles to be deposited within very short distances ({\textless} 50 m) from the fire edge.},

We further develop the model to calculate the potential charcoal source area (PCSA) for several classes of fires. Results suggest that (1) variations in airborne charcoal deposition can be explained largely by the size of PCSAs relative to fire sizes and (2) macroscopic charcoal travels many kilometers, longer than suggested by dispersal data from experimental fires but consistent with dispersal data from uncontrolled fires.},

@article{Connor2012,
	abstract = {Fire is currently perceived as a major threat to ecosystems and biodiversity in the mountains of the Mediterranean region. Portugal's highest mountain range, the Serra da Estrela, is one of the country's most important protected areas and also the most fire-prone. We present a ∼14,000-year fire history based on microscopic charred particles in an infilled glacial lake to better understand the antiquity of biomass burning and its effects on Mediterranean vegetation at the Atlantic margin. Results indicate the continuous occurrence of fire in the Serra da Estrela over the period of the record. Two periods of increased fire activity – around 12,000–11,000 calendar years before the present (cal. a BP) and 3500–2500 cal. a BP – were accompanied by major vegetation changes and followed by long periods of vegetation stabilisation. Cross-correlation analyses reveal that post-fire succession consistently began with herbaceous vegetation, followed by forest and shrubland stages. Past successional trends were often markedly different to those observed at present. Holocene climatic changes, including shifts in the North Atlantic Oscillation, played a pivotal role in the vegetation development and fire history of the Serra da Estrela. In the late Holocene, human use of fire became a major agent of vegetation change, accelerating the Holocene decline of forests.},

@article{Patterson1987,
	abstract = {Charcoal preserved in lake sediments, peat, and soils provides a record of past fire occurrence. An understanding of fire history is important in evaluating interactions between vegetation, climate and human disturbances through at least the last several millennia. In this paper we review information concerning the production, dispersal, sedimentation and preservation of charcoal. We present examples of studies that have used charcoal analysis in palaeoecological reconstructions, with special emphasis on analytical techniques and problems of interpretation. Unlike pollen, which is produced continuously in fairly constant amounts, charcoal is produced in large quantities but at irregular intervals. These are a function of fire regimes that are often unique to specific vegetation types and/or climatic regions. Charcoal particles vary in size from sub-microscopic to macroscopic, with small particles presumably being transported further by wind and water than large particles. Charcoal preserves well, but it may be subject to breakage, especially when transported by water. We present theoretical models of dispersal and discuss potential problems associated with post-depositional mixing. A variety of charcoal analysis techniques have been employed during the past four decades. Most involve microscopic identification and quantification of numbers or size of individual fragments occurring in samples prepared for pollen analysis. The most commonly used method — estimating charcoal area by categorizing particles in several size classes — is both tedious and time consuming, and recently introduced techniques attempt to estimate past fire occurrence based upon point count estimation, elemental carbon analysis, magnetic measurement of sediments, electron microscope, and spectrographic analyses. A lack of standardization both within and among analysis techniques has hampered interpretation of charcoal profiles. Taphonomic processes affecting charcoal are less well understood than for pollen, and as a result interpretations of historic interactions between vegetation and fire based upon pollen and charcoal analyses are difficult. We review several studies through which advances have been made and suggest questions for future study.},

The annually laminated sediments of Lake of the Clouds permit precise dating of the charcoal peaks and record the changes in the influx of various pollen types. A detailed record of the past 1000 yr shows that the average frequency of fire is approximately 60–70 yr, with a range of about 20–100 yr. The amount of charcoal in sediments dating between 1000-500 y.a. is consistently higher than that for the last 500 yr, although the fire frequency for the two periods was not appreciably different. Pollen analysis shows no change or only short-term changes in the percentages of major pollen types following charcoal peaks.},

@article{Wilmshurst2014,
	abstract = {Islands play a key role globally in the conservation of endemic species. Many island reserves have been highly modified since human colonization, and their restoration and management usually occur without knowledge of their prehuman state. However, conservation paleoecology is increasingly being recognized as a tool that can help to inform both restoration and conservation of island reserves by providing prehuman vegetation baselines. Many of New Zealand's mammal-free offshore islands are foci for biological diversity conservation and, like many islands in the Polynesian region, were deforested following initial human settlement. Therefore, their current restoration, replanting, and management are guided either by historic vegetation descriptions or the occurrence of species on forested islands. We analyzed pollen and ancient DNA in soil cores from an offshore island in northern New Zealand. The result was a 2000-year record of vegetation change that began {\textgreater}1200 years before human settlement and spanned 550 years of human occupation and 180 years of forest succession since human occupation ceased. Between prehuman and contemporary forests there was nearly a complete species turnover including the extirpation of a dominant conifer and a palm tree. The podocarp-dominated forests were replaced by a native but novel angiosperm-dominated forest. There is no modern analog of the prehuman forests on any northern New Zealand island, and those islands that are forested are dominated by angiosperms which are assumed to be climax forests. The pollen and DNA evidence for conifer- and palm-rich forests in the prehuman era challenge this climax forest assumption. Prehuman vegetation records can thus help to inform future restoration of degraded offshore islands by informing the likely rate and direction of successional change; helping to determine whether natural rates of succession are preferable to more costly replanting programs; and providing past species lists if restoration replanting is desired.
